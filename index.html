  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Hyoyeon (Yeona) Lee</strong>. I build end‑to‑end data & ML systems for semiconductor and finance. My interests include Bayesian optimization, robust/trustworthy ML, and quantitative research.</p>

  <h2>Highlights <img src="/assets/img/samsung-badge.svg" alt="Samsung Electronics" style="height:22px;vertical-align:-4px;margin-left:8px"></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI model optimization at large-scale manufacturing sites.</strong> On real DRAM mass‑production lines, deployed ML optimization frameworks on high‑volume test streams and achieved record‑high yields for new products. Engineered Bit Line Sense Amplifier (BLSA) optimization with Python and C/C++; built a cloud edge‑computing–based platform that performs real‑time optimization and automation across multi‑device testing environments. Afterward, I directly set up the ML optimization system for <em>all</em> incoming DRAM product requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Big‑data & platform engineering.</strong> Designed and operated a TB‑scale parallel processing framework using Dask, PyArrow, and AWS Glue to handle production logs. Fully automated anomaly detection via Airflow pipelines. Authored seven reusable automation tools that reduced repetitive tasks by ~90%, with results validated by team and division awards.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent R&D (Algorithms · Causal/RL).</strong> Performed defect‑cause inference using ML data analytics, hybrid ML tuning for process parameters, and robust reinforcement learning. Results include an IEEM‑accepted paper and presentation, two patents, and CEO/Best Paper awards.</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership · Communication · Education.</strong> Served as Culture Agent for a 50‑member team and taught internal ML seminars (won Best Seminar Award). Consistently connected seminar/research insights to independent decision‑making on new algorithm development projects.</li>

  <h2>Project <strong>Alpha‑Helix</strong> 🧬 — End‑to‑End Quantitative Research & Trading System</h2>
  <p class="disclosure">Open personal side project (company work is proprietary).</p>
  <p>This single, large‑scale project contains three tightly integrated modules to demonstrate true “full‑stack” capability across the entire quant lifecycle — from data ingestion to research and live execution.</p>

  <div class="module" id="chronos">
    <h3><strong>Module 1: “Chronos” · Datalake — Governing the time of data</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Goal:</em> Build an automated, high‑quality data pipeline that becomes the foundation for all quantitative research (emphasizing data‑engineering skill).</p>
    <p><em>Key capabilities:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automated ingestion.</strong> Use Airflow to automatically collect historical market and on‑chain data every day and store it in object storage such as S3.</li>
      <li><strong>Data quality management.</strong> Integrate Great Expectations into the pipeline to automatically validate missing values, outliers, and schema, and generate human‑readable reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficient storage & access.</strong> Leverage Parquet and DuckDB so that even very large datasets can be loaded in seconds for any requested time window and shape.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="module" id="hermes">
    <h3><strong>Module 2: “Hermes” · Real‑time Signal Engine — Delivering the market’s signals</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Goal:</em> Receive market data in real time, analyze it, and generate meaningful trading signals with minimal latency (emphasizing ML engineering / algorithmic trading skill).</p>
    <p><em>Key capabilities:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Asynchronous data processing.</strong> Use <code>asyncio</code> and WebSocket to ingest data from multiple exchanges simultaneously in a non‑blocking fashion.</li>
      <li><strong>Real‑time feature extraction.</strong> Use Redis as a state store and compute rolling microstructure features (e.g., OFI, realized volatility) directly on the stream.</li>
      <li><strong>Message‑queue architecture.</strong> Employ Redis Pub/Sub to decouple ingestion → feature extraction → signal generation, ensuring scalability and robustness.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="module" id="athena">
    <h3><strong>Module 3: “Athena” · Strategy & Insight Dashboard — Finding wisdom in data</strong></h3>
    <p><em>Goal:</em> Discover new alpha strategies using the datalake and signal engine, and analyze/monitor their performance in an intuitive way (emphasizing quant strategy skill).</p>
    <p><em>Key capabilities:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Regime‑based strategies.</strong> Use ML models such as HMM to classify the market into regimes (trend / range / high‑vol) and automatically switch strategies per regime.</li>
      <li><strong>Systematic experiment management.</strong> Adopt MLflow to record parameters, performance metrics, and result charts for a large number of backtests, enabling rigorous comparison.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive dashboard.</strong> Build Streamlit/Dash dashboards to monitor current regime state, recommended strategies, paper‑trading performance, and key on‑chain indicators.</li>
    </ul>
