Author's description:

The defunct CursorMania had a single Select cursor called Sparkly Ice that was always my favourite when I was a kid. Now that CM is defunct, I thought I'd give a whole cursor set the Sparkly Ice treatment.

The original cursor is included in the set for completion's sake. All the other cursors are based on the default Windows XP cursor set.

This set can be freely distributed as you wish. Credit is nice but not required. Enjoy the glitter!
